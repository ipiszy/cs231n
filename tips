1. Broadcast on one column: 
   e.g. A + B[:, None], where A.shape = (N, D), and B.shape = (N)

2. A.dot(B) + A.dot(C) = A.dot(B + C)

3. max() with sum() (more generally, if condition with "sum"): 
   matrix operation: np.maximum(); 
   more complex operations: using binary matrix and dot product.
